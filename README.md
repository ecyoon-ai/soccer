# ‚öΩ AI-Based Soccer Video Analysis and Performance Tracking

## üìù 1. Project Overview

This project utilizes deep learning and computer vision techniques to provide an automated solution for analyzing **player performance** from soccer videos. It is based on the **YOLO11 framework** for object detection, combined with the **DeepOcSort tracker** and **Pose Estimation** techniques, offering two core analysis functionalities.

| Analysis Module | Key Feature | Intended Purpose and Main Use Scenario |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shot Counting** | Automatically **counts shooting attempts** by analyzing changes in player joint angles and the distance between the player and the ball. | The system helps measure training efficiency by automatically recording the number of attempts **when players practice corner kicks.** |
| **Player Tracking** | **Real-time trajectory tracking** and visualization of all player movements on the field. | Used for strategic planning and performance evaluation through analysis of individual player activity, positioning, and movement patterns during a match. |

## ‚ú® 2. Key Features

* **State-of-the-Art Technology:** Leverages **Ultralytics YOLO11** for high accuracy and fast inference speed.
* **Pose Analysis:** Uses YOLO Pose Estimation to precisely determine shooting actions based on changes in major joint angles.
* **Multi-Object Tracking (MOT):** Employs the **DeepOcSort** tracker with a Re-ID model to maintain stable object IDs and visualize movement paths.
